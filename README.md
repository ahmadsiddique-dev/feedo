# Oh btw Read this
> There is an issue with the Email provider as we need to submit our domain name there that we don't have(if you are thinking about vercel domain name then we cannot use it because I don't own it vercel owns it ) So that is why we have enabled to put any random six digit code we will verify it

But once we have a domain name we will make it so don't worry!
